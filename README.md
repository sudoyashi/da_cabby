A collection of my project notes on cars, design, and other hobbies that I decided to spend ~~a silly~~ my valuable amount of money and time into.
## \#1. Da Cabby - The Lil Carbureted Convertible

My 1985 Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet is my first project that I started learning on since getting my own beginner socket and wrench set in 2020. I have spent roughly $10,000 inclusive of the fees, maintenance costs, custom parts, and other useless things I shouldn’t have bought. It’s probably more, but I stopped counting at 5 figures for this shitty hunk of metal lol.

With about $300 in starter tools like basic hand tools for the normal project car enthusiast, it wasn't long before I started putting in more money the more addicted I got to wrenching. Impact wrenches, specialty bits, suspension tools, more power tools, and so on. The list of stuff that was both useful and useless is too much to bother with. But overall, I don’t think $10,000 is a terrible amount for what I have. A decently working car that is absolutely unsafe and 100% worth the effort when it finally pulled through.

Refuse to give up, and you shall be rewarded.

## \#2. Swagon - The Daily Wagon

My 2007 Audi A3 is not technically a project car, but it's definitely a car that I want to keep around to modify in the end. Acquired in June 2022, I was and still am attracted to the drivability of a car, with the benefits of interior space of an SUV, hence the wagon. I don't have too much to say about it yet, but I will be writing more about it soon!

## \#3. CAD - Where Cardboard and Computers Collide

CAD was something elusive to me. I've always been surrounded by computers and design work, yet I could never put it together until necessity came around. Designing parts for the Volkswagen, the possibilities of CAD and 3D parts were finally blown open. Making gaskets, flanges, and block-off plates proved to be a cunning exercise in Google searching, YouTube learning, and learning a lot about materials.
