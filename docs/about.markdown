Roughly $10,000.

This is my first project car and since getting my own beginner socket and wrench set in 2020, until now, I have spent roughly $10,000 inclusive of the fees, maintenance costs, custom parts, and other useless things I shouldn't have bought. It's probably more, but I stopped counting at 5 figures for this hunk  of metal lol. 

I believe I started with about $300 in tools, basic hand tools for the normal project car enthusiast. Impact wrenches, specialty bits, suspension tools, more power tools, and so on. The list of stuff that was both useful and useless is too much to bother with. But overall, I don't  think $10,000 is a terrible amount for what I have. A decently working car that is absolutely unsafe and 100% worth the effort when it finally pulled through. 

Refuse to give up, and you shall be rewarded... probably. It worked for me.

## Fuel System

The part that I've invested in the most since owning the car and what was stopping the car from moving in the first place.

**CIS is out. Carburetors are in.**

- Originally manufactured with CIS (Continuous Injection System), the system was replaced with a simpler carburetor system. 
- Manifold and head flange made by DanST Engineering. Made decently well. Carburetor adapter kit was great, though the head flange I will say is not so user-friendly with where the bolts were placed. I don't think there was much room but oh well, haha.
