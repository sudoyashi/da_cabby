Roughly $10,000.

This is my first project car and since getting my own beginner socket and wrench set in 2020, until now, I have spent roughly $10,000 inclusive of the fees, maintenance costs, custom parts, and other useless things I shouldn't have bought. It's probably more, but I stopped counting at 5 figures for this hunk  of metal lol. 

I believe I started with about $300 in tools, basic hand tools for the normal project car enthusiast. Impact wrenches, specialty bits, suspension tools, more power tools, and so on. The list of stuff that was both useful and useless is too much to bother with. But overall, I don't  think $10,000 is a terrible amount for what I have. A decently working car that is absolutely unsafe and 100% worth the effort when it finally pulled through. 

Refuse to give up, and you shall be rewarded... probably. It worked for me.

## Fuel System

The part that I've invested in the most since owning the car and what was stopping the car from moving in the first place.

**CIS is out. Carburetors are in.**

- Originally manufactured with CIS (Continuous Injection System), the system was replaced with a simpler carburetor system. 
- Manifold and head flange made by DanST Engineering. Made decently well. Carburetor adapter kit was great, though the head flange I will say is not so user-friendly with where the bolts were placed. I don't think there was much room but oh well, haha.

## Story Time: How I bought my car for $800

I actually bought my cabby on a whim. For $800, I got a vibrant metallic orange convertible that I knew very little about. BBS wheels! Classic VW! A fucking steal! 

My grade school best friend Ronald, my cousin Rey, and Mark went out to Waipahu to checkout the car. It was listed on craigslist for $1800. Not too many problems, sometimes it didn't want to start, the fan didn't work, and it has been sitting for about 2 years. It definitely had the rust in the pictures, but it was the classic car in my head that I've always imagined. As we drove out on the midsummer afternoon, we pulled up and there it was, sitting underneath a Milo tree. Not too clean but not too dirty either.

We checked out the car and as soon as I opened that door, it had that distinct smell of an 80s car. The smell of old leather and stale air sat happily in the cabin. Eric, the guy that was selling the car, took some time to show me how to start the car. For some reason, putting the car into first gear helped to get the car running... though in retrospect, I think it was coincidence. The ignition switch definitely doesn't have anything to do with the gear. But miraculously, the car started! 

The car putted out a cough from its sitting engine and after warming up, it sounded pretty decent. 

We let the car warm up for a bit and I went out for a test drive. Wrinkling up the leather seats, I sat in the cabin and found it impossible to adjust the car seats. The plastic sliders were definitely broken, so adjusting the seat meant forcefully thrusting my body back and forth to adjust the seat. I was fucking nervous to drive. This is the second time I've gone out to buy a car, but I only learned how to drive manual about 5 weeks ago! I was panicked to not look like a total dunce, but I wanted to buy the car. I needed to drive.

Clutch in. I lightly pushed the shifter into what I thought was first gear, but the linkages practically floated in to some position that only resembled 1st. It was a mechanical linkage that resembled jello and a jumbo crayon being dragged right through it, fucking weird, man. But I got it into "a" gear and made it out of the driveway. I stumbled out and gave it a good rev before pulling out past the stop sign. "First gear" with the revs up and I stalled. Okay, try it again.

"First gear" with the revs even higher and I just barely managed to pull out. I was definitely trying to pull out in 3rd gear. 

But with the revs finally up and the car finally moving, I rolled down the windows to let the musty air flow out. Still getting a feel for the steering and suspension, the car surprisingly drove pretty well! A California stop into the next stop sign and I finally opened up to an open road. Car's warm and I was itching to see what the car was going to be like. I pulled out and nearly floored it. And this car did NOT pull, haha! But what it did do was that it putted down the road like a panther's prowl. Low and subtle. And for some reason, the lack of power and flabbergasting experience driving an 80s car put me in a different headspace. This isn't a car to drive for speed, this is a car to peacock the fuck outta these streets.

I absolutely wanted that car and instantly become attached. This car was cool as fuck.

I returned to the driveway and feeling pretty good about the car. We let the car run for a bit to see how the car would idle. As I got out of the car my friends were talking with the owner at the time and everything seemed to be going great. It was finally time to start talking about price. His Craigslist ad listed the car for $1800 since it was in mildly rough condition, I was just about to offer $1500 considering that this was going to need a bunch of work to refresh and get it safely on the road... and then a heater hose blew.

White smoke straight from the hood. Ronald quickly shouted "turn it off!" and the car just sat there among the silence as the car shut down. With the leaking fluid and smoke clearing up, we were trying to figure out what happened. The white smoke was a clear indicator, but at the time, I didn't know the difference between any of the smoke colors! All I knew is that it was bad. When everything settled down, the car was not in a condition to run anymore
