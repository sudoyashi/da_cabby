<br>

This is my 1985 Golf Cabriolet project car, with the vision to make it a quick and fun NA cruiser around Hawai'i.

Though we are quite far from the goal. I'll use this website to keep track of my progress and discuss some of my project ideas, parts, and experiments along the way. More importantly, I'd like to hopefully use this website to help inspire others to go for silly projects on their own.

There's some pretty cool shit out there and we can't have it all. Just pickup a shitty car and get going!

## I'm not a mechanic. But I like cars.

I actually bought my cabby on a whim. For $800, I got a vibrant metallic orange convertible that I knew very little about. BBS wheels! Classic VW! A fucking steal!

But like many enthusiasts out there, I don't think many of us were mechanically inclined when we first picked up our very first project car.

I didn't know how to drive a manual transmission. <br>
I didn't know how to do an oil change. <br>
I didn't own any tools!

But I really liked cool cars. And this car was cool as fuck.

## Starting a project cars

But I really liked cars, and it's only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars.

So, during the pandemic in mid 2020, I bought the car and instantly bought a starter set of tools for me to get wrenching. We strapped the idle Volkswagen back to my sister's house about a mile away with a loose tow strap and a lot of hope. My best friend from kindergarten drove my other car while I steered my new project car.

I called my sister after the fact to park my new car in front of her house, thankfully she was fine with it. I spent the next 3 weeks looking through the manual, learning, doing, and making a bunch of mistakes and trips to Home Depot and O'Reilly's for new parts and supplies.

The story of my project car could be translated across every first project:

1. Boy likes car.
2. Car breaks down.
3. Boy hates car.
4. Boy somehow gets the car working.

Repeat step 1 until you run out of money.

And the cycle repeats.

## Starting a project car

Why not join in and spend all your extra time and money like us?

It was only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more about automotive. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars! Well, and money. As of 2022 if you're a broke boy like me, $4000 should get you a car that's decent enough. Maybe I'll write more about picking a project, like the hundreds of other guides out there.

Ah, just YouTube it.
