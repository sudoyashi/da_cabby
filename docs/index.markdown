[Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet Mk1](/docs/cab.jpg)

This is my 1985 Golf Cabriolet project car, with the vision to make it a quick and fun NA cruiser around Hawai'i. Though we are quite far from the goal. I'll use this website to keep track of my progress and discuss some of my project ideas, parts, and experiments along the way. More importantly, I'd like to hopefully use this website to help inspire others to go for silly projects on their own.

There's some pretty cool shit out there and we can't have it all. Just pickup a shitty car and get going!

## I'm not a mechanic. I just like cars.

Like many enthusiasts out there, I don't think many of us were mechanically inclined when we first picked up our project car.

I didn't know how to drive a manual transmission.
I didn't know how to do an oil change.
I didn't understand the difference between tires, wheels, front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive.

But I really liked cars, and it's only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars. Hope you enjoy what you find on this website.
