![1985 Golf Mk1 convertible](/assets/img/cab.jpg)
<br>

This is my 1985 Golf Cabriolet project car, with the vision to make it a quick and fun NA cruiser around Hawai'i.

I didn't start out mechanically-inclined at all. But regardless of my experience and circumstance, I wanted to pickup my first project car and by a stroke of luck, I got this Golf Mk1. There are so many times I actually have regretted picking up this car, I didn't realize how much work there was to do and experience I was missing! Quite frankly, I was willing to dump this car multiple times because I was absolutetly stumped on what to do. 

If there's anything that you really need to keep a project car is tenacity. Refuse to give up.

When I disassembled the disc and drum brakes for the first time, it took 2 months for me to get the correct parts and understand how to put it together.
When I disassembled the cooling system for the first time, it took 4 months to properly diagnose the parts that were bad.
When I disassembled the fuel system, it's still a work-in-progress.. haha.

80% of the time I've owned this car, it was sitting in the garage. But on during the glorious 20% of time it works, it is one of the most euphoric and blissful feelings I have ever worked for in a long time.

## How did I find the car?

I actually bought my cabby on a whim. For $800, I got a vibrant metallic orange convertible that I knew very little about. BBS wheels! Classic VW! A fucking steal! 

My grade school best friend Ronald, my cousin Rey, and Mark went out to Waipahu to checkout the car. It was listed on craigslist for $1800. Not too many problems, sometimes it didn't want to start, the fan didn't work, and it has been sitting for about 2 years. It definitely had the rust in the pictures, but it was the classic car in my head that I've always imagined. As we drove out on the midsummer afternoon, we pulled up and there it was, sitting underneath a Milo tree. Not too clean but not too dirty either.

We checked out the car and as soon as I opened that door, it had that distinct smell of an 80s car. The smell of old leather and stale air sat happily in the cabin. Eric, the guy that was selling the car, took some time to show me how to start the car. For some reason, putting the car into first gear helped to get the car running... though in retrospect, I think it was coincidence. The ignition switch definitely doesn't have anything to do with the gear. But miraculously, the car started! 

The car putted out a cough from its sitting engine and after warming up, it sounded pretty decent. 

We let the car warm up for a bit and I went out for a test drive. Wrinkling up the leather seats, I sat in the cabin and found it impossible to adjust the car seats. The plastic sliders were definitely broken, so adjusting the seat meant forcefully thrusting my body back and forth to adjust the seat. I was fucking nervous to drive. This is the second time I've gone out to buy a car, but I only learned how to drive manual about 5 weeks ago! I was panicked to not look like a total dunce, but I wanted to buy the car. I needed to drive.

Clutch in. I lightly pushed the shifter into what I thought was first gear, but the linkages practically floated in to some position that only resembled 1st. It was a mechanical linkage that resembled jello and a jumbo crayon being dragged right through it, fucking weird, man. But I got it into "a" gear and made it out of the driveway. I stumbled out and gave it a good rev before pulling out past the stop sign. "First gear" with the revs up and I stalled. Okay, try it again.

"First gear" with the revs even higher and I just barely managed to pull out. I was definitely trying to pull out in 3rd gear. 

But with the revs finally up and the car finally moving, I rolled down the windows to let the musty air flow out. Still getting a feel for the steering and suspension, the car surprisingly drove pretty well! A California stop into the next stop sign and I finally opened up to an open road. Car's warm and I was itching to see what the car was going to be like. I pulled out and nearly floored it. And this car did NOT pull, haha! But what it did do was that it putted down the road like a panther's prowl. Low and subtle. And for some reason, the lack of power and flabbergasting experience driving an 80s car put me in a different headspace. This isn't a car to drive for speed, this is a car to peacock the fuck outta these streets.

I absolutely wanted that car and instantly become attached. This car was cool as fuck.

## Starting a project car

But I really liked cars, and it's only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars.

So, during the pandemic in mid 2020, I bought the car and instantly bought a starter set of tools for me to get wrenching. We strapped the idle Volkswagen back to my sister's house about a mile away with a loose tow strap and a lot of hope. My best friend from kindergarten drove my other car while I steered my new project car.

I called my sister after the fact to park my new car in front of her house, thankfully she was fine with it. I spent the next 3 weeks looking through the manual, learning, doing, and making a bunch of mistakes and trips to Home Depot and O'Reilly's for new parts and supplies.

The story of my project car could be translated across every first project:

1. Boy likes car.
2. Car breaks down.
3. Boy hates car.
4. Boy somehow gets the car working.

Repeat step 1 until you run out of money.

And the cycle repeats.

## Starting a project car

Why not join in and spend all your extra time and money like us?

It was only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more about automotive. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars! Well, and money. As of 2022 if you're a broke boy like me, $4000 should get you a car that's decent enough. Maybe I'll write more about picking a project, like the hundreds of other guides out there. Thankfully, we have the internet.
