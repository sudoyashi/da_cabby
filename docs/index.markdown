This is my 1985 Golf Cabriolet project car, with the vision to make it a quick and fun NA cruiser around Hawai'i.

I didn't start out mechanically-inclined at all. But regardless of my experience and circumstance, I wanted to pickup my first project car and by a stroke of luck, I got this Golf Mk1. There are so many times I actually have regretted picking up this car, I didn't realize how much work there was to do and experience I was missing! Quite frankly, I was willing to dump this car multiple times because I was absolutetly stumped on what to do. 

If there's anything that you really need to keep a project car is tenacity. Refuse to give up.

But I really liked cars, and it's only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know.

## Free shit

- A collection of [THREE CAD parts](cad.md) that kinda fits your Golf Mk1. Be warned, these aren't perfect.

That's all the free things I have.
Maybe I'll make stickers or something.
