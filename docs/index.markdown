![1985 Golf Mk1 convertible](/assets/img/cab.jpg)
<br>

This is my 1985 Golf Cabriolet project car, with the vision to make it a quick and fun NA cruiser around Hawai'i.

I didn't start out mechanically-inclined at all. But regardless of my experience and circumstance, I wanted to pickup my first project car and by a stroke of luck, I got this Golf Mk1. There are so many times I actually have regretted picking up this car, I didn't realize how much work there was to do and experience I was missing! Quite frankly, I was willing to dump this car multiple times because I was absolutetly stumped on what to do. 

If there's anything that you really need to keep a project car is tenacity. Refuse to give up.

80% of the time I've owned this car, it was sitting in the garage. But on during the glorious 20% of time it works, it is one of the most euphoric and blissful feelings I have ever worked for in a long time.

## Starting a project car

But I really liked cars, and it's only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars.

So, during the pandemic in mid 2020, I bought the car and instantly bought a starter set of tools for me to get wrenching. We strapped the idle Volkswagen back to my sister's house about a mile away with a loose tow strap and a lot of hope. My best friend from kindergarten drove my other car while I steered my new project car.

I called my sister after the fact to park my new car in front of her house, thankfully she was fine with it. I spent the next 3 weeks looking through the manual, learning, doing, and making a bunch of mistakes and trips to Home Depot and O'Reilly's for new parts and supplies.

The story of my project car could be translated across every first project:

1. Boy likes car.
2. Car breaks down.
3. Boy hates car.
4. Boy somehow gets the car working.

Repeat step 1 until you run out of money.

And the cycle repeats.

## Starting a project car

Why not join in and spend all your extra time and money like us?

It was only until I started learning how to work on cars that I really got the drive to work and learn more about automotive. I always thought that to have a project car, you had to know everything that you needed to know. You needed to learn about engine swaps, know every single car out there and it's pros and cons, know the HP numbers, and all this other technical jargon to be a car guy.

But frankly, you don't need to know any of that. You just need to like cars! Well, and money. As of 2022 if you're a broke boy like me, $4000 should get you a car that's decent enough. Maybe I'll write more about picking a project, like the hundreds of other guides out there. Thankfully, we have the internet.
