# Do I really need torque specs?

Yes, you need them.

The only place that it would be acceptable is on small components like valve cover fasteners, headlights, or other fragile pieces.

If you need to use two hands, you probably need a torque spec. But still, even if you have a good torque feel, you should be aware of the torque specs at least once before going by "feel".

I used to think I didn't need them, then one day my wheel almost fell off. Great lessons are learned just before failure, eh?

## This is the introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>
While  this is on a Mk1 or A1 chassis, most, but not all, Mk1 chassis will have the same torque specs. In the case of suspension, because the convertible is heavier by design, the suspension bits could differ slightly. Buuuut, I haven't gone through every single torque spec to see a noticeable difference where I have touched thus far.

Overall, here are all the torque specs I could find of every part! Hope it's useful.
