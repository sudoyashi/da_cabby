- Draft 1 results: Holes are NOT correctly lined up as I am 2mm off center. If you find this part as of 4/20/2022, eliminate the holes and drill according to your own JH head using an intake manifold gasket.

- Draft 1 results: Mostly works! Needs a bit of bending, holes need to be drilled.

This is a draft part! You could use it on your mk1, but it will need modification where the bends and cuts are for the metal inserts. 

Material: steel or stainless steel. Aluminum would break if you don't bend it well.
