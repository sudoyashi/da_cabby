This is a draft part! I have not fully installed the parts yet as I am still waiting for the parts from SendCutSend.com (as of 4/7/2022).

This is a draft part! You could use it on your mk1, but it will need modification where the bends and cuts are for the metal inserts. 

Material: steel or stainless steel. Aluminum would break if you don't bend it well.
