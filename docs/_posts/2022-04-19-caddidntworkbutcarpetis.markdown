I've stalled on making a video on my bike carb conversion long enough. It has technically been running...  very poorly. Running poorly after a year since making my first video isn't convincing anybody, so I decided to do it properly.

## The issues

Vaccuum leaks. The vacuum leaks were almost always present, except for one time that I thought I really did fix it! 

And I  honestly thought I did, until I ran a smoke test. I came to find out that the leak was so massive that the hissing sound was gone. Looking at the gap from the warped intake manifold, it was clear that I needed to redo my work.

This smoke tester helped a lot, and would highly suggest adding it to a DIY diagnostics kit.



Knowing that the smoke test proved my vacuum leaks, I added another gasket, gunked it with RTV and tried to go my merry way. This did not work. The RTV didn't make a good enough seal, I used new fasteners and that didn't help either. I tried removing the inner flange but the cheap Amazon ball-nose allen wrench sheared right in the socket. So I gave in, and simply drove with my vacuum leak.

## Did you fix it?

Not really. I decided to run it for a while and found that I could still drive with decent AFR ratios, I adjust my setup to run much richer to account for the vacuum leaks. This is not what you should do. I know that many of the true carb guys would probably admonish me for not fixing the actual problem, but I really wanted to just drive the car. 

It was almost approaching a year of not driving the car, and if it could go just around the block, I was satisfied.

## So the real plan is to actually fix it!

Okay, so I actually plan on fixing it, foreal this time. How can I fix this issue? 

I know the issue, it's a vacuum leak. How do you fix a vacuum leak? Seal it. Specifically from the intake manifold seals. 

The easiest way to check this out is to take off the head and inspect my flanges and seals for warping. Knowing the manifold was bent, it's not far off to think the flange was warped as well. Same goes for the seals that probably cause the warping from a leak, this caused a backfire in my carburetors. It was cool at first because I wanted to spit flames, then I found out that this was bad and not cool at all.

To fix this I had few options:
- Buy a new flange and gaskets to replace them
- Check for flatness, mill and reuse the same gasket
- Check for flatness, make my own gaskets and parts

I decided to make my own.

## CAD, not the cardboard kind

![CAD Draft](/assets/cad-intakezx6r.png)

It was a good excuse to finally learn more about CAD and machining. I learned graphic design and used graphic design in my projects before, so I figure I should jump into CAD. I used OnShape to design and SendCutSend, per recommendation from SuperFastMatt. Honestly, a lot of inspiration came from superfastmatt to make my own things. 

Though I lack the experience and technical knowledge, I have stupidity and tenacity. 

Making the gaskets and flange were very daunting

I first traced the gasket on a piece of paper then made arbitrary measurements with my cheap calipers and ruler. They were arbitrary because every measurement had +/- 2mm of variation. In machining, this is terrible. After a lot of google and youtube, I finally made something that looked identical to the part. I appended a part to cover my fifth intake hole since the original aftermarket part didn't account for this. 

Essentially, I made this part even better. Right?

## Testing with a smoke machine

Unfortunately, my laser-cut flange did not work as planned... I missed it by 2mm.

My measurements made it not unusable but it's a very good learning experience. 

I might have been better off having a solid piece and drilling out the holes myself to match everything perfectly. Since I can't use the new part to seal off everything, I had to make a small patch with body filler to the portion of the original flange to a part that I had made a small incision.

With the part patched, I sanded the aluminum piece on a long piece of wood with 400/800/1500 sandpaper to maintain the face squareness. It was not going to be a perfect flat surface, but I needed to remove the leftover material from my previous RTV sealing attempts. I tested the flatness with a machinist square and it was good enough!

I didn't need to install the head yet, but I place it on there gingerly to test the flange sealing. I hooked up the smoke test in most of the same way as I did before and...

oh my goodness it worked.

3 days of learning and using cad paid off. In honesty, it probably saved me about $30. But that's $30 I could use to buy whatever I want.

I reinstalled the head:
- new head gasket
- new head bolts
- new exhaust gaskets
- reinstall headers
- reinstall intake flange
- reinstall carbs
- refill fluids
- reinstall valve cover gasket
- start the car!
We should easily start the car at this point, aaaaannnd.

## And it worked!

This was a first for me, an actual DIY achievement for me. I designed my first bolt-on engine parts. Now, this wasn't a performance part but it wasn't particularly an easy part either. It took a lot of testing and trials and to see it come to fruition is something I can't buy with bolt-on parts.

Once everything was fastened down for the second smoke test, to my surprise, it sealed very well! Great! I've got a sealed head without the vacuum leaks. Originally when I was running the car a couple months ago, I ran INCREDIBLY rich, like 12:1 AFR rich, and that carbon buildup showed on the pistons, so I will need to adjust the idle jets from the very rich 150 jets, down to 140. An educated guess.

To go two steps down means choosing a smaller jet, one that has a smaller orifice. Jets generally change in steps of 5, so in my case I am going down from 50 -> 45 -> 40. From my testing on this rig, each step I made modified the AFR by 1x, so two steps down means increasing the AFR by 2. The goal is to reach 14:1, at least that's the plan haha. Changing jets aren't too difficult, just a bit of a pain to drain fuel on each attempt.

Now that the air leak problem is finally solved, I'll retune the carbs in a few ways:
- Set the throttle plate position on the bench
- Confirm all seals, clamps, and other moving parts are  in ok condition
- Disassemble and prepare the head installation.

## Looking Forward: Clean the engine, install the head

![Head complete](/imgs/engine head/head.jpg)

The block needs some cleaning from all that carbon, so I can get all of that done pretty easily. I'm SUPER stoked that I have a good chance of a succesful engine now, so in a couple weeks when everything is buttoned up, I'll be up and running just in time for summer.

Cleaning block means using a green scrubby pad and being very careful not to get any particles in the holes. After cleaning the carbon, clean up the engine bay to prevent further contamination, lightly oil the cylinder bores, and reinstall the head!
