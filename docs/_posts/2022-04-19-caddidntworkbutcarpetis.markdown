Unfortunately, my laser-cut flange did not work as planned... I missed it by 2mm.

Seems my measurements were off too much to make it possible to use. I might have been better off having a solid piece and drilling out the holes myself to match everything perfectly. Since I can't use the new part to seal off everything, I had to make a small patch with body filler to the portion of the original flange to a part that I had made a small incision.

With the part patched, I sanded the aluminum piece on a long piece of wood with sandpaper to maintain the face's level. It was not going to be a perfect flat surface, but I needed to remove the leftover material from my previous RTV sealing attempts.

Thankfully, the original aftermarket flange was good to go. The laser-cut cork gaskets fit and used them to seal up the intake side. From the head to the flange, then the flange to the intake runners. I torqued everything by hand and ran a smoke test on the whole rig, and what do you know, everything is sealed! Mostly, actually, there's still a tiny leak coming from runner one. However, with some RTV added on the the edges of the seal, it shouldn't be a problem.

Great! I've got a sealed head without the vacuum leaks. Originally when I was running the car a couple months ago, I ran INCREDIBLY rich, like 12:1 AFR rich, and that carbon buildup showed on the pistons, so I will need to adjust the idle jets from the very rich 150 jets, down to 140. An educated guess.

To go two steps down means choosing a smaller jet, one that has a smaller orifice. Jets generally change in steps of 5, so in my case I am going down from 50 -> 45 -> 40. From my testing on this rig, each step I made modified the AFR by 1x, so two steps down means increasing the AFR by 2. The goal is to reach 14:1, at least that's the plan haha. Changing jets aren't too difficult, just a bit of a pain to drain fuel on each attempt.

NOW that the air leak problem is finally solved, I'll retune the carbs in a few ways:
- Set the throttle plate position on the bench
- Confirm all seals, clamps, and other moving parts are  in ok condition
- Disassemble and prepare the head installation.

## Looking Forward: Clean the block, install the head

The block needs some cleaning from all that carbon, so I can get all of that done pretty easily. I'm SUPER stoked that I have a good chance of a succesful engine now, so in a couple weeks when everything is buttoned up, I'll be up and running just in time for summer.
