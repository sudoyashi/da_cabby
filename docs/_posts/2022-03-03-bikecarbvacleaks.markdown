Carb conversion solving vacuum leaks

I've had this vacuum leak issue since installing my carburetors and I would attribute this to user error, aka my dumbass, than the parts themselves.

When I first set out to do my carb conversion I had no idea what I was doing and was vaguely following instructions from a myriad of youtube videos and forum posts that vaguely described what I was supposed to do. I don't blame these sources either because my lack of experience on the fundamentals of engine and carb design really set me back.

My goal in this video is to describe the fundamentals behind a practical install of bike carburetors on a car. I wanted to simplify it enough that you could go in with a better understanding than I did when I first attempted this. 

I've made a video on the principle of converting to bike carbs, but this one is a bit more practical. More than just hook this up, do this and that, and bango you've got a conversion, but with my experience and the errors I've run into, I think this will probably help the 6 people that are bored enough to do this... probably. 

Let me reiterate, carb conversions are not for power. They're aren't for drivability. It's just another option you can go towards reviving an old car you like. In retrospect, I probably should have gone for the full CE2 ABA swap, but I don't think I would have known how to do that without going through this process of understanding the exchange between the fuel, intake, combustion, and electrical systems.

#### Diagnosing the vacuum leak

Let's start with the current condition of the car, it has a vacuum leak.

A common culprit in any "rough running" condition is the result of a vacuum leak. Big or small, it will give you a bad day. There's a few ways to go about this:

- Spraying carb cleaner, water, or any flammable substance of choice because you forego all caution in desparation to fix this car
  - Spray where you think there is a leak
- Propane
  - Expel propane
- Smoke testing
  - My favorite, expel pressurized white smoke to indicate a leak
- Using a cigar
  - Cheap method, take a vacuum hose and a cigar and blow

The goal is simple, use a substance to indicate a leak in the air system. The two most common ways are to use some gas that will interact with combustion, propane or flammable gas OR using smoke, that will smoke where it is leaking.

I'd recommend a smoke test, it will indicate even the tiniest pinhole because it is pressurized. Against the other 3 which take ambient air pressure.

Go over every possible place that may leak air. Starting from your engine intake ports and work backwards.
1. Intake manifold flange
2. Intake manifold
3. Hoses leading to intake after fueling
4. Hoses before fuelilng
5. Vacuum advance
6. Vacuum sensors
7. Brake booster
8. And so on.

Once you've find your vacuum leak, we'll go about the way on how to fix it.

If it's a gasket you can replace, replace the gasket. If it's a cut hose or loose hose, replace the hose and/or clamp that secures it. And if a connection is simply loose, tighten it up.

Vacuum leaks are simple, there's a leak to secure. But, simple doesn't mean easy in these cases. This is why I recommend smoke testing, you can find exactly where the leak is coming from, but even that doesn't make it easy to solve. 

My vacuum leak is coming from the head, the intake manifold flange. I have two gaskets there and I'm unsure which one it's coming from since they're so close together. What does a smoke test indicate?

- The path of least resistance.

This means that while you will solve the weakest vacuum leak, it may not be ALL the vacuum leaks. The hole might be so big that all the smoke goes to that spot. Once that's covered, smaller holes might appear because the big one is gone. Repair and retest.

Let's fix this leak.

- I'm going to be removing the head... I could do this when the engine is still in but the bolts are stripped and I need to get around that.



Removing the Mk1 head

1. Start draining the coolant
2. Disconnect your electrical connections
   1. ground strap on the valve cover
   2. thermoswitch
   3. oil pressure switch
3. Disconnect vacuum, fuel, and air connections
   1. Brake booster
   2. Vacuum hoses
   3. Intake hoses
   4. Exhaust system
   5. Carburetors, throttle body, etc. (throttle cable included)
4. Remove alternator belt
5. Disconnect the cooling system
   1. By now the coolant should have drained out from the head flange.
6. Removing the remaining timing components
   1. SET YOUR TIMING TO TDC
   2. Remove the timing belt

The process is very similar to an engine swap. Disconnect everything that is connected to the engine head. Once that's done, remove the head itself

- Remove the valve cover
- Remove the 10 head bolts,
  - When removing the head, we want to avoid warping as much as possible
  - The order we remove isn't nearly as crucial as installation, but due diligence never hurt in this process
  - Start from the outside and work your way in,
    - Using a breaker bar, break loose each bolt by hand
    - Electric impact wrench to do the rest of the work
  - Store the bolts safely. I'm reusing mine since they're relatively new.
- Once removed, confirm all other connections are free.

Have a place to put the head, make sure it's free of contaminants.

- Lift the head straight off the block and place it down gently. 

Congrats, the head is off. Now it's time to do some inspection up close.

<hr>

My prime suspect is the intake manifold flange to the head, this is where it was leaking the most. I am guessing that it got burnt up from driving lean. 

The flange bolts are stripped in my case, and rounded socket heads are the worst. To remove them, I'm going to first try jamming it with a Torx bolt. I also know that one of my Allen heads snapped in the bolt itself. For this one, I'll attempt with a Dremel, cut a slice to jam a flathead, and remove it that way.

Finally, after removing the bolts, I can inspect the flange for flatness, the intake side of the head, and the gasket itself.



The problem here was the.....



- (Machine shop?)
- (Flatness?)
- Bad gasket

<hr> 

A new gasket

- I took the time to recreate this gasket out of a thicker cork gasket through CAD and SendCutSend.
- This took some time for me since I'm new to CAD
- The gasket 

<hr> 

Assembly

- This is probably the most nerve-wracking part for me, I wasn't sure if everything was going to be totally fixed but I took enough time to do things right this time, I think we've got it.

First, we'll assemble and clean up the head back into working order. I added RTV to the intake manifold flange gasket and let that sit and set up for an hour before torquing the flange. Since it's a custom part, I went off the specs of a regular intake manifold torque spec. 25 lb. ft.  Then, I'll install the carburetors with my vacuum balance bar for a smoke test. With the head off the block, air will exit out of the valves.

Hook up the smoke test, or whatever smoke you want, and inject that shit.

If everything goes well, the smoke will exit out of the path of least resistance, the throttle plates. If the intake side is sealed up, it will only be able to exit out of there. Play with the throttle and open and close it to confirm the intake is sealed. Triple check by introducing light. With a light shining in each intake port, verify that there are no gaps in the intake system.

At this point, with this part FINALLY, FINALLY solved preliminarily, we can reinstall our head. I'll remove the carbs, for now, to make installation easier.

<hr>

I'm reusing the head bolts but I got a new head gasket. $20 insurance.

Take a clean paper towel and gently clean the block face that will seal to the head. Wipe a light coat of oil on the cylinder walls, again, precautionary. Double-check to make sure that the cylinder is at TDC. This will make timing much easier.

Line up the new head gasket with the locating dowels, then take the head and place it square on the block.

Install the head bolts.

- Starting from the inside and working our way out, start hand tightening the head bolts. Do this until all 10 are in.
- Next, torque it down to 30 lb-ft
- Then 43 lb-ft
- Finally, two 90* turns for each head bolt

Reattach the timing belt, this way we can confirm that the timing is okay. With the timing belt reattached, spin the engine clockwise, in the direction the car is going on an LHD car, and confirm that it spins smoothly. Reset the engine back to TDC.

<hr>

Installation should be straightforward, reattach all the lines, connectors, and sensors that are attached to your car. Install the exhaust manifold, then the intake manifold. Don't forget your gaskets.

One last check before putting fluids back in, with the intake, exhaust, and head installed, we can re-test with smoke for any leaks. Reconnect the smoke system and pressurize the intake. If the smoke is coming out of the throttle body, then well done. If not, welcome to the club. Again, vacuum leaks are simple but not easy. See if the vacuum leak is coming from elsewhere.

Add in your distilled water, and lightly pour some oil into the head to replace any lubricants lost. Spin the engine once more and confirm the timing. If everything is connected, prime the oil pump by removing the terminal 15 ignition coil wire. This will take away the spark and allow only the starter to work the engine. This will prime the fuel bowls and oil lines. As well as cycling some water through the cooling system. If all is satisfactory, reconnect the wire, and hold your breath.
