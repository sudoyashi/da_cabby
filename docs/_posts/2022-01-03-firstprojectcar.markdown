# Enjoy your first project car.

For the early 20 somethings, this is probably where you're at.

- Insurance rate isn't so great on your following
- Probably can't buy a car on credit
- Used car market is whack... as of 2021/2022
- User car market will be riddled with mechanic specials at cheap prices

The guidelines that I set for myself was to find something that was dirt-cheap and something you want to drive. That's how I bought my car.

But every circumstance is different. If you're okay with buying on credit because you can back it up, that's fine. Have someone that can lend you the money interest-free? Go ahead. The biggest thing to really take away is that BUYING the car is not going to be the expensive part. The real money comes in with what you plan to do with the car afterwards.

## How I started: A pandemic and having money to blow

Quite honestly, a project car came out of boredom, Donut Media's new series Money Pit, and me wanting to spend money on something I could learn and enjoy.

It all pointed to one thing baby: a project car.

So, during the pandemic in June 2020, I bought the car and instantly bought a starter set of tools for me to get wrenching. We strapped the idle Volkswagen back to my sister's house about a mile away with a loose tow strap and a lot of hope. My best friend from kindergarten drove my other car while I steered my new project car.

I called my sister after the fact to park my new car in front of her house, thankfully she was fine with it. I spent the next 3 weeks looking through the manual, learning, doing, and making a bunch of mistakes and trips to Home Depot and O'Reilly's for new parts and supplies.

The story of my project car could be translated across every first project:

1. Boy likes car.
2. Car breaks down.
3. Boy hates car.
4. Boy somehow gets the car working.

Repeat step 1 until you run out of money.

And the cycle repeats.
