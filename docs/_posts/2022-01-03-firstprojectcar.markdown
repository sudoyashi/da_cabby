# Enjoy your first project car.

For the early 20 somethings, this is probably where you're at.

- Insurance rate isn't so great on your following
- Probably can't buy a car on credit
- Used car market is whack... as of 2021/2022
- User car market will be riddled with mechanic specials at cheap prices

The guidelines that I set for myself was to find something that was dirt-cheap and something you want to drive. That's how I bought my car.

But every circumstance is different. If you're okay with buying on credit because you can back it up, that's fine. Have someone that can lend you the money interest-free? Go ahead. The biggest thing to really take away is that BUYING the car is not going to be the expensive part. The real money comes in with what you plan to do with the car afterwards.
