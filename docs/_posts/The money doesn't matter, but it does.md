The money doesn't matter, but it does.

From hearing about the car's issues, it's going to cost about $7000 to repair everything? Fuck me lol. I feel so foolish buying this car, allowing the pressure to just make me buy the car. I let myself get in this position and now I've gotta find make my way out.

There's two options, either keep the car or sell it and get another one.

Keeping the car would mean keeping up with the rest of the maintenance for the life of the car, which is going to be about 600-1500 a year, registration (370), insurance (70/mon), comes out to 2000 a year or 166 a month. That's not including the $7000 that I'm planning to spend plus the added costs of doing any cosmetic work to the car. We're looking at about $15,000 spent on the first year of the car for a 2007 Audi A3 Wagon.

The other option is to sell the car for cheap about $4000 and make my way up from there. I'll have the 5500 in hand to put down on something else. At this point, I've spent about $1800 on the car apart from the actual costs of the car. The largest costs being the floor mats, diagnosis, hood latch, and the scan tool. Otherwise, I could easily eat the cost of the smaller pieces of the car like the oil change, headlight restore, the air filters, and so on.

The danger is trying to find another car, which can come with a whole other set of problems, or go overpriced and find a car new/used for about $15,000-24,000. It'd most likely be a Volkswagen because I honestly enjoy the driving experience of the car, plus I have the tools for it and all.

So what do we do? I've already sunk in $6,000 so far. I basically did the dealership route for an older used car. But at that point, the problems would be fixed, right?

You have the money and time to get it fixed. You have a car that is something that you do enjoy. Do you like the car enough to fund it? The car market is shitty right now. The last thing you want to stress out about is another car, being tired, and not enjoying yourself. There are more things to think about than just having to worry about a car. You've made it through worse, for sure.

A year from now, you will have made about $50,000. Of that, 1/3 would be going towards cars. Another 1/3 would be towards savings. The rest of for you to spend. Your pay is going to get, hopefully, slightly better. Within a year, you'd have a very nice and working car. Easy maintenance and you are well on your way being all debt-free. In a year, you'd forget a lot of the trouble and enjoy having the Audi around. You could also be enjoying driving a new Ford Maverick if you wait long enough,  a decent used Honda Civic for about $15-18,000. The works. That's another $10,000 added on if you're going to go off and buy a newer car, along with the add-ons, gas, etc. 

The car market isn't exactly getting better and there probably isn't the right choice. You can afford making this car nice again.  This is the kind of technical sweet spot that I do enjoy about these cars. There aren't the super high-tech safety features, but at the same time, it's comfortable, leather, and bears a presence of old/new swag. Nothing cooler than a wagon and the icon and image is something that I do value over the monetary costs. Once I fix the car, it's maintenance, taking care of the car, and having something that I can own up to. I'm going to continue making mistakes and this was a decent dent in me. I didn't trust my gut with what I found. I knew it wasn't the car I should get, but it's the car I wanted. I got let Ricky drive the wagon and sincerely see him enjoying himself. 

If these are the only issues, then I can be okay with it. You have 4,000 in a loan to pay off the big purchases first. You can also use their 6 month interest-free plan to leverage more of it. You can work this out. With 4000 under loan. Were you really happy with the VW TDI? Were you really happy with the Mazda 3? You are happy with having an Audi. Cause it's a FUCKING AUDI WAGON. At the end of the day, because I can afford to swallow this all and have a decent job, I can make it.

I'll be leaving Kaneohe in less than a year. I'll be making my way back to Foster Village, save some more money and put that away towards a different car? I can also take care of the Audi for the years and years to come. Once the car is repaired, you'll be looking nice. You know how to take care of a car and you can drive. You can enjoy yourself in something that you know that you wanted to have it. Never settle. Drive the Golf for a bit or ask to Turo from Wade/Sy. You'll be okay.
