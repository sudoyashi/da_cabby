I started to redo the interior from March 7, 2022. Having the ability to put the car into a closed garage has been a godsend in the house I'm living in right now.

Originally, I would be wrenching outdoors and would have to popup a tent when I wanted to work on the car the whole day! With pets, kids, and 5 other cars in the driveway, it wasn't ideal to be working on the car all day. Since moving, it has allowed me the time, space, and environment to focus on my car without worry about everyone else.

## How long did it take?

From start to finish, this took me over 50 work hours. 
- Remove door cards, shift boot, VDO gauge cluster, seats, and other fixins
- Removing the old carpet and anything that was rotting underneath
- Remove old butyl with dry ice and hammer
- Clean, remove and patching any holes
- Repainting to prevent rust
- Install kilmat, sound deadening butyl
- Install closed cell foam
- Install cut and place mass loaded vinyl
- Cut, place, and install new carpet

It was incredibly tough to get everything put together and push myself to finish this project. Initially, I didn't think it was going to take over a month, but because of my birthday, the flu, and other life events, I had to put off the project for a bit. Was it worth doing it on my own versus taking it to the shop? Yes, absolutely.

This car is NOT going to be a major show car, so I could cut corners and pay the price later. As much as I love this car, it is not a relic to stand the test of time. There are MANY other examples of better Golf Cabriolets out there so I am not inclined to particularly *save* this car and keep it purely stock. I think what purists get too caught up thinking that these cars are incredibly rare and tough to find. Yes, of course they may be hard to find, but you can find dozens upon dozens of well kept Golf Mk1s out there. I have no intention of doing a full restore because of the absurd amount of money I would be sinking in. I would much rather sink it into something that is actually rare and tough to find.
