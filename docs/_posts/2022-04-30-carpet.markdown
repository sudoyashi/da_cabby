I started to redo the interior from March 7, 2022. Having the ability to put the car into a closed garage has been a godsend in the house I'm living in right now.

Originally, I would be wrenching outdoors and would have to popup a tent when I wanted to work on the car the whole day! With pets, kids, and 5 other cars in the driveway, it wasn't ideal to be working on the car all day. Since moving, it has allowed me the time, space, and environment to focus on my car without worry about everyone else.

## How long did it take?

From start to finish, this took me over 50 work hours. 
- Remove door cards, shift boot, VDO gauge cluster, seats, and other fixins
- Removing the old carpet and anything that was rotting underneath
- Remove old butyl with dry ice and hammer
- Clean, remove and patching any holes
- Repainting to prevent rust
- Install kilmat, sound deadening butyl
- Install closed cell foam
- Install cut and place mass loaded vinyl
- Cut, place, and install new carpet

It was incredibly tough to get everything put together and push myself to finish this project. Initially, I didn't think it was going to take over a month, but because of my birthday, the flu, and other life events, I had to put off the project for a bit. Was it worth doing it on my own versus taking it to the shop? Yes, absolutely.

This car is NOT going to be a major show car, so I could cut corners and pay the price later. As much as I love this car, it is not a relic to stand the test of time. There are MANY other examples of better Golf Cabriolets out there so I am not inclined to particularly *save* this car and keep it purely stock. I think what purists get too caught up thinking that these cars are incredibly rare and tough to find. Yes, of course they may be hard to find, but you can find dozens upon dozens of well kept Golf Mk1s out there. I have no intention of doing a full restore because of the absurd amount of money I would be sinking in. I would much rather sink it into something that is actually rare and tough to find.

## The Cost: $760

On all the materials, not all tools: ~$760

| Item                         | Price |
| ---------------------------- | ----- |
| Carpet                       | $180  |
| Kilmat 36 sq.ft (2)          | $120  |
| Closed Cell Foam Noico Red   | $120  |
| Mass Loaded Vinyl 25 sq. ft. | $80   |
| Rollers                      | $20   |
| Aluminum Insulating Tape     | $20   |
| Die grinder + supplies       | $115  |
| Dry Ice                      | $30   |
| Metal body filler            | $40   |
| Butyl cord                   | $15   |
| 3mm plastic sheeting         | $19   |
| **TOTAL**                    | $759  |

For my case, I went nearly full teardown and buildup. I would have spent more on welding and bigger patching materials if I had the income to do so, but I decided to go with metal body filler instead. 

The biggest costs were obviously in the materials: carpet and sound deadening. If you are reusing your carpet, great! You save about 20% of the costs. If you are not installing sound deadening and just replacing the carpet, that is about 70% of my total costs.

I probably could have saved myself more trouble by cheaping out, but it may have not lasted as long. I probably could have future-proofed this car by doing more proper metal repair and professional installation, but it defeats the purpose of a project car on a budget.

Of course, not having tools would make this an expensive first project; however, this assumes you have a good garage set of tools which means a basic socket and wrench set, screwdrivers, prying tools, and cutting tools. This also assumes you have an air compressor, grinder, mallets, buckets,and cleaning supplies as well. 

Lastly, body condition and other pieces you need to buy and replace will be a possible variable.

The car is something I want to enjoy driving in comfort, not for performance. It will be far too expensive to make this car fast, haha.
