Eventually, I plan on adding a 276 to improve the powerband dyanmic for the Mk1. A new camshaft, a worthy mod for its own post.

While a new camshaft does not technically add major power on its own, a new camshaft would shift the powerband over between the RPM range. There are three factors that the camshaft will affect:
- duration; how long a valve will be open and close
- lift; how far a valve will open and close
- timing; the timing change the combustion cycle between the head and the block
-

The goal of the camshaft is to change the profile of combustion at different RPM ranges. Remember the camshaft will not necessarily add power but modulate it (we're excluding the power gains from duration as this will increase air intake). However, the camshaft in combination with other modifications to the head such as a port & polish and performance exhaust system will improve power as a whole.

In a simplified view, an engine can get more power with more air coming in and going out of the engine. This pushes the crankshaft faster and faster, ultimately moving our wheels.

## From simple to complex, picking a camshaft

Great! You want more power, but how do you choose? Firstly, what are your goals?

For pure racing, you can lean towards a more aggressive camshaft.
For street (racing), you might be in the middle between mellow and aggressive.
For street and commuter use, you might as well not get a new cam and buy new tires instead.

Yes, a mild cam can improve your performance, but compare it to the cost of other modifications that you can do. An adage that I've heard when building a car is to go from the outside in. This means:
- Start with your suspension and aero, then work towards the engine as the final means of modifications

Save for an exhaust system, improve your cooling systems, buy new wheels, tires, and suspension, and confirm you have a strong electrical system with proper grounds and wires. All of this can come long before even thinking about camshafts.

Did all of that already? Let's go into a study and talk about a camshaft for the cabby.
