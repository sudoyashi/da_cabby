There aren't a terrible amount of issues with the car, I will just be carless for about 2 weeks. Can I depend on the volkswagen to take me everywhere LOL.

### Two Scenarios with the coolant temp sensor

- Possibly bad thermostat, not allowing the coolant to run through properly
  - When thermostats fail on most VW and Audis the cars tend to run too cold instead of overheating.  This means even after the car has run for some time the vehicle will not reach proper operating temp.  This is because the thermostat is stuck open. 
- Possibly bad coolant temp sensor, not reading the correct coolant temperature
  - If overheating is an issue, it's more likely the coolant temp sensor.



The good thing is that the car ISN'T DYING anytime soon from the cooling issue. Just not gonna push as hard. The coolant issue is something that I will just pay for. I can pay for it and I can stand to drive the cab for a few days. With that said, I should also do another coolant/water flush before putting more fluid into the VW.

The few other things that I can also prepare for in the meanttime is to do the cam follower maintenance. 



Next things i can do is find my engine code, I can figure a bit more about the car then decide what I'm going to do next.

I got really stressed that the car wasn't going to turn out well. There's a handful of things that pointed to a terrible time, but I'm smarter now and I'm just going to pay for the repairs NOW. If it means giving up my time to drive in early so that the Volkswagen can make it in time, that's fine. 

I'm still stressed because it feels like for the past few years now, I really have been in a sort of limbo where I just feel like I haven't done anything to put myself in a confident position. I tried doing Peace Corps so I could better government opportunities and make myself a better candidate for something in the future,  but it didn't work out as intended. I hated my job later on in a federal position. Americorps felt like a terrible time sink for 8 months. Working now is finally okay, but it took me years to end up back where I was in the first place, just working IT. If I started 3 years ago, I probably would be making a lot more and feel more comfortable.



It does come back to money, I feel like I've done so little when I look at my sisters. They're doing well. They have families. They are older and have a head start in life, literally. Why should I compare myself? Because that's how I've viewed myself.

I feel incredibly lonely sometimes. As much as I'm surround by good friends and family, I lowkey just want attention.

Today feels a little better after having a small dinner with Janiene. I think I am just feeling lonely and it really helped to have someone around for a bit. In a way, it was reassuring that I wasn't the only one having a tough time recently. She has another court date coming up and has to attempt to get an international driver's license. For her case, she has those issues coming up on her plate. For me, I have to get ready to move houses again since my temporary permanent housing situation is about to expire soon. Living in Kaneohe was a literal breath of fresh air but we can't have everything. Having COVID, watching the dogs at the house, and trying to balance everything between Kaneohe and Waipahu, I was having a hard time swallowing everything down at once trying to buy a car, sell a car, considering every little moving part in between, it was stressful for me. Having dinner put me at ease because I could at least

I changed the Hood latch yesterday, it took about 45 minutes to install because I was having trouble with the electrical connector. Once that was over, things went pretty smoothly. Having that torx set was an absolute clutch, though I am missing a fastener after forgetting to install one back.. lol.

I feel a bit more confident about the car. I cleared the codes for now hoping that the Coolant One will come back in time. I want to be able to read the coolant temperatures this time. Today, I'm going to be picking up a few more things for the barbecue on Sunday. A couple chairs and brake fluid from Volkswagen. After that, I'll help out mom with the Wi-Fi. Once all of that is done, I'll make time to wash the Audi and get it lightly detailed for the time being.

I'll do a quick wash, dry it, then get to work with clay bar on the whole thing. Once the clay bar is set, I'll apply #9 polish, then #7 show car glaze, then finish it with the caranuba wax.

I feel much more confident this week after settling back at home. I've washed my clothes, I'm eating normal meals now, if I can fit in a 5-10 minute run to get back in the groove, then that would be good.
