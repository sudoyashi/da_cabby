I think what I struggle with the most is that I don't really know anyone or can positively closely relate to the position I'm in. People whom I wish I'd find and be able to relate to are other guys in social justice, social issues, bridging the gap between blue and white colored Filipinos. I fell hard for the model minority stereotype because I see that most of whom I associate with, the people I see and relate to are mostly on the blue collar side. The people that I identify with the most, because I am Filipino or brown-skinned, I feel we fall short of others in terms of social desirability, attractiveness, masculinity, and socioeconomic class. 

I believe in this because it has been my experience trying to breakthrough stereotypes and being exposed to this reality around the states and in other countries.

There are very few role models that I can think of that are colored Asian American men that are not solely popular for their looks. It is a challenge because the peers whom I grew up with, we have proudly deviated away from mainstream popularity to achieve social hierarchy, and yet I still feel weak and rejectful of my identity as an Asian male.

Reading books specifically about shared experiences among Filipino and Hispanic Americans helped to clarify my self-rejection, where a lot of it comes from our cumulative life experiences and the lack of relatability when it comes to social standing. 

I am asian, but I'm not the stereotypical Asian.
I am Filipino, but I'm not from the Philippines and cannot speak my native tongue.
I am American, but I seldom feel patriotic to my country.

Internally, I try to fight my social and racial bias, for and against my own ethnic group, but in the end, I have a hard time claiming pride in my Filipino Identity and it hurts a lot to think that. I have little to no  anecdotal evidence that proved that being Filipino gave me the competitive edge in a social, professional, or economical way.

Knowing all of this, I want to be a role model to other colored Asian men, and in particular to Filipinos, because you must be proud of your skin. Absoluetly proud. But honestly, it is not enough to want and seriously manifesting myself as a role model. In what ways can I pridefully exude my pride? Embrace your identity. Learn your culture. And find out what you see is amazing and spectacular. Create and endeavor for goals that will shock others and most importantly, impress yourself. You need to understand your own worth and if other recognize it, that's great, but you must recognize the work that you have done and attribute the efforts of your skills.

Filipinos belong to the brown race, and they are proud of it. They cherish a story that accounts for the difference in the races. According to Malay folklore, long ages ago the gods who dwelt upon the earth shaped clay after their own image and baked it. In the first trial they baked it too long and it came out burned—the Negro. They tried again. This time they removed the clay too soon—the white man. The third time they were successful; they produced just the right product—the brown man.
